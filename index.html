    <p>Hello! And welcome to my recipes page. Now, you're probably wandering why it looks so different. 
        It's because further ahead in the course, one of the assignments is to go back to your receipes page 
        and decorate how you like it now that you know the basics of CSS.
    </p>

    <p>How am I enjoying the course? So far, very much. You know those teachers in school that were so good that it made you enjoy the subject even though
        it's quite possible you had no interest in it? Well, the Odin Project is sort of like that except you've chosen to be there. It's not forced on you, 
        and the more assignments they give you, the more it sinks in that this is a very comprehensive salad of a resource that is amalgamated from tons of other
        ingredients that, yes, you could have found on your own - but would you have? Would you have known the steps to understanding? Would you know what to 
        Google and when? How would you track progress?
    </p>

    <p>Trust the process. Take it one step at a time. Follow along. Watch additional Youtube videos if the concepts seem complicated. 
        It will start to make sense. You will forget things, but the resources are always there. 
    </p>
